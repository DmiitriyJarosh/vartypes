VarTypes is a feature-rich, object-oriented framework for managing variables in C++ / Qt4.

VarTypes allows hierarchical organization, thread-safety, load/store to/from xml, Qt4-based signals, Qt4-based model/view visualization.

VarTypes aims to make it easy for application developers to integrate automatic settings loading/storage, even for complex trees of settings. At the same time it allows a user to comfortably edit such settings in real-time without any risks of concurrency problems.

Among supported base types are int, bool, double, string, string enumerations, lists, binary data, and triggers. More complex types can be added easily.
